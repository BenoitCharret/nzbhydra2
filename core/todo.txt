GUI
- !!! Reverse proxy support (done in settings)
- Config (getting, setting): Mostly done
- Update notification: Mostly done
- !!! basic Searching
- !!! searching with exclusion
- !!! searching by ID, autocomplete

Searching
- return indexerName access data to show in GUI
- !! pick indexers: show in GUI
- exclusions: mostly done
- !!! rejecting search results: mostly done
- !!! ID conversion: mostly done
- !!! query generation
- !!! search history: mostly done
- !!! hitlimit and downloadlimit
- global retention

Config
- !!! Loading
- !!! Updating
- !!! Setting via web call
- !!! reloading config: Mostly done
- find out which settings require a restart and mark them accordingly
- !! test that yaml is updated with missing/new keys
- !!on first start initialize config with secret, api key, etc and save to file.
- make sure existing file is not overwritten with defaults by mistake
- how to migrate from "old" yaml??
- what happens when you overwrite a setting from the command line and then save from the GUI?
- check for changing of database file. perhaps move old one over
- make sure that database file starts with ./ for relative paths
- save indexers in list by name to make finding them easier

Downloader support: mostly done
- sabnzbd
- nzbget

NZB handling
- downloading: partly done
- referral, proxying: partly done
- get details
- !! downloading zip of NZBs

Indexer support
- binsearch
- nzbindex
- anizb
- !! nzbclub is gone!!
- !! checking caps
- !! checking auth / connection: done

Torrent support
- special handling
- downloading directly

Updater: Proof of concept with wrapper works
- update notification
- self updating

Process control
- Restart: Works, based on wrapper
- Shutdown: Works, based on wrapper

Authorization https://kielczewski.eu/2014/12/spring-boot-security-application/
- mostly done
- !! log user name for appropriate actions
- enabling auth requires restart

History & stats
- Search history: mostly done
- Download history: mostly done
- Stats: mostly done

Backups
- !! Save
- Restore: Probably using the wrapper
- create periodically (done, but needs to be checked if actually executed
- create before updating
- test what happens when search is executed while backup is made

Windows GUI
- perhaps use java gui: https://github.com/kemitix/spring-boot-awt-gui-demo or http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22864008/how-to-configure-spring-boot-with-swing-application
- in that case updating will get even worse...

News
- poll periodically from repo for news
- show news on startup for any given version
- only show news to admins
- save display state in database instead of cookie

General, Ideas
- !! open browser on startup
- !! delete results older than x, perhaps do this as first background task?
- !! package static files in jar when delivering
- !!! user agent http://springinpractice.com/2013/10/27/how-to-send-an-http-header-with-every-request-with-spring-resttemplate
- wrap searches in ~30s timeout to prevent wrong code or other issues fucking up the system
- !! Log / config sanitation
- !! more config validation. make sure auth is properly configured, etc
- !! config validation with error and warning level. warn when eg no indexer capable of id search is enabled
- !! Initialize config
- !! timeout for indexer accesses is "global" (max time spent for access)
- !! migrating from old installation (config and database), either via web call or via loading from file system. dont migrate searchresults. warn for all settings not taken over (like proxy)
- !! restart dialog pings until recognizes successful restart
- !! catch all API errors and let user decide if a) code 500 is returned b) XML with error code c) empty results
- dashboard in stats section, downloads, API searches, normal searches, application errors in the last x days
- !! rss functionality with configurable caching, perhaps with cache interval as parameter
- banner
- verify that retrieving user from remoteuser works with form based login and rememberme
- when no indexers configured / available, on search page show a note and link to config
- ! debug tab in system section to execute raw sql queries
- log API access user agent in info column and show in history?
- !! proper GUI filtering of search results
- !!! if indexer statuses is collapsed and at least one indexer had an error show a growl warning
- use config setting "isUseLocalUrlForApiAccess"
- !! compare stats from python version and migrated
- !! episodes can be strings
- !! option to download torrent file to predefined folder
- ! caps (don't support audio)

currently not (yet) supported:
- proxies


++++
Improvements
- Way faster (searching, database handling, processing, stats). TODO: Get some numbers
- Hopefully more stable in the long run
- Fully unicode compatible TODO: Test this ;-)
- Background processes
- In the future: Cancel searches, self updating
- Sends all available identifiers instead of just one
- show which indexers where not picked for what reason
- Reverse proxy support is better (doesn't matter if called by trailing slash)
- Option to add and remove categories
- better validation for configuration, including warnings
- store IP address in search / download history. opt-in. use nullable column. show what available in history
- catch all API errors and let user decide if a) code 500 is returned b) XML with error code c) empty results
- option to execute SQL queries for debugging
- option for torrent black hole
- proper postfiltering of results on GUI
- rss functionality with configurable caching, with cache interval as parameter
- option to display indexers' category names instead of mapped ones
