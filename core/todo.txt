Backups
- Save

General, Ideas
- Log / config sanitation
- Initialize config
- overwrite config file
- timeout for indexer accesses is "global" (max time spent for access)
- migrating from old installation (config and database), either via web call or via loading from file system
- restart dialog pings until recognizes successful restart
- clean up old search results
- catch all API errors and let user decide if a) code 500 is returned b) XML with error code c) empty results
- dashboard in stats section, downloads, API searches, normal searches, application errors in the last x days

++++
Improvements
- Way faster (searching, database handling, processing, stats). TODO: Get some numbers
- Hopefully more stable in the long run
- Fully unicode compatible TODO: Test this ;-)
- In the future: Background processes, cancel searches
- Sends all available identifiers instead of just one
- Reverse proxy support is better (doesn't matter if called by trailing slash)
...
